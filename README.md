# ![4Geeks Logo](http://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=4geeks,16) TODO List with React

✏ *Create a TODO list application that allows users to add and delete tasks with **React**. Inspired in **./preview.gif***.

## Instructions 📄

* The tasks are added when the user enters any text and press the ***Enter*** key.
* The delete icon shows on the side of every task. In <u>large</u> resolutions they will be displayed on ***hover***; In <u>small</u> resolutions they will be displayed by default.
* The user can add as many tasks as needed.
* When there is no tasks the list will say *No tasks, add a task*.
* The number of added tasks is displayed in the lower left corner.
* If there are added tasks, the ***Remove all*** button will be displayed in the lower right corner.
* The tasks can only be deleted.

## Preview 🎬
* You can open this repository in **Gitpod**.
* Start the webpack server with live reload running the next command: `$ npm run start`
* If you can't start the server, run the following command: `$ npm install`
